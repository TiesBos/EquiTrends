Testing for parallel trends is crucial in the Difference-in-Difference
framework. The goal of EquiTrends is to provide a set of functions to
test for equivalence of pre-trends in difference-in-differences
estimation, based on the placebo coefficients (used to compare the
trends of the treated and control group in the pre-treatment period to
some base period, generally the final period in the pre-treatment
period). The procedures follow the work of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121)).

The package contains the functions `maxEquivTest` to perform the testing
procedure surrounding the maximum placebo coefficient (see equation
(3.1) of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121))),
`meanEquivTest` to perform the testing procedure surrounding the mean
placebo coefficient (see equation (3.2) of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121))) and
`rmsEquivTest` to perform the testing procedure surrounding the root
mean squared placebo coefficient (see equation (3.3) and (3.4) of Dette
& Schumann ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121))).
Furthermore, the package contains the function `sim_paneldata` to
simulate a paneldataset for such testing purposes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of EquiTrends from
[GitHub](https://github.com/TiesBos/EquiTrends) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TiesBos/EquiTrends")
```

## Data Simulation

The `EquiTrends` package contains a function to simulate panel data,
tailored to the Difference-in-Difference framework. The function
`sim_paneldata` simulates a panel dataset with a given number of
individuals $N$ (`N`), number of periods $T+1$ (in the setting of this
package, indicating the number of pre-treatment periods. In
`sim_paneldata` $T+1$ is referred to as `tt`), number of covariates $p$
(`p`), and treatment effects. Generally, period $T+1$ is referred to as
the “base period”. The function returns a data frame with the following
columns: `ID` (the cross-sectional individual identifier), `period` (the
time identifier), `Y` (the dependent variable), `G` (a binary vector
indicating if an individual receives treatment, indicated by 1, or not,
indicated by 0), and `X_1`, `X_2`, …, `X_p` (additional control
variables). The function also allows for the simulation of heterogeneity
in treatment effects (specified through `alpha`), time fixed effects
(through `lambda`), heteroscedasticty (specified through the binary
variable `het`), serial correlation (through the AR(1) coefficient
`phi`), and clustering of the standard errors. The construction of the
dependent variable follows the two-way fixed effect model, similar to
the model in equation (2.5) of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121)):

$$Y_{i,t} =  \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{l=1}^{T}{\beta_l}G_iD_l(t) + X_{1, i, t}\gamma_1+ \dots + X_{p,i,t}\gamma_p +u_{i,t} \quad \text{with} \  \ i=1,...,N, \ \ t=1,...,T+1$$

where $D_l(t)$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if $t=l$ and 0
otherwise. The error-terms $u_{i,t}$ are generated through a normal
distribution with mean 0 and a variance-covariance structure depending
on the user-specified parameters. In the following, the $\beta_l$
coefficients are referred to as placebo coefficients, since they
represent the difference in pre-trends between the treatment and control
group before treatment has been assigned.

An example of the `sim_paneldata` function is provided below:

``` r
library(EquiTrends)

# Simulate a panel dataset with 500 individuals, 5 periods, 2 additional 
# regressors, and a binary treatment variable without heteroscedasticity, 
# serial correlation, and clustering. Furthermore, there are no fixed effects or 
# pre-trends in the model (since all values in beta are 0).
sim_data <- sim_paneldata(N = 500, tt = 5, p = 2, beta = rep(0, 5), 
                          gamma = rep(1, 2), het = 0, phi = 0, sd = 1, 
                          burnins = 50)
head(sim_data)
#>   ID period          Y G        X_1        X_2

## Testing for Equivalence of Pre-Trends

The `EquiTrends` package contains functions to test for equivalence of
pre-trends in difference-in-differences estimation. The functions
`rmsEquivTest`, `meanEquivTest`, and `maxEquivTest` are used to test for
equivalence of pre-trends in difference-in-differences estimation using
the placebo coefficients $\beta_{l} \ (l=1,...,T)$ estimates. The
functions are based on the work of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121)).

### The `rmsEquivTest` function

`rmsEquivTest` implements the equivalence testing procedure surrounding
the root mean squared placebo coefficient as described in section 4.2.3
of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121)). The function
tests the null hypothesis that the root mean squared placebo coefficient
is larger than or equal to a user-specified equivalence threshold,
$\delta$, indicating what negligible is to the user. That is, if

$$\beta_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{l=1}^{T} \beta_l^2},$$

the tested hypotheses can be represented as

$$H_0: \beta_{RMS} \geq \delta \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \beta_{RMS} < \delta.$$

The null and alternative hypothesis can therefore be seen as
non-negligible and negligible differences in pre-trends, respectively.
The function returns an object of class `rmsEquivTest` containing

- `placebo_coefficients`: A numeric vector of the estimated placebo
  coefficients,
- `rms_placebo_coefs`: The root mean squared value of the placebo
  coefficients,
- `significance_level`: The significance level of the test,
- `base_period`: The base period used in the testing procedure,
- `num_individuals`: The number of cross-sectional individuals in the
  panel used for testing,
- `num_periods`: The number of pre-treatment periods in the panel used
  for testing (if the panel is unbalanced, `num_periods` represents the
  range in the number of time periods covered by different individuals),
- `num_observations`: The total number of observations in the panel used
  for testing,
- `is_panel_balanced`: A logical value indicating whether the used panel
  is balanced,
- `equiv_threshold_specified`: A logical value indicating whether an
  equivalence threshold was specified.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = TRUE`, then additionally:
  - `rms_critical_value`: The critical value at the alpha level,
  - `reject_null_hypothesis`: A logical value indicating whether to
    reject the null hypothesis,
  - `equiv_threshold`: The equivalence threshold specified.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = FALSE`, then additionally:
  - `minimum_equiv_threshold`: The minimum equivalence threshold for
    which the null hypothesis of non-negligible trend-differences can be
    rejected.

One should note that rows containing `NA` values are removed from the
panel before the testing procedure is performed.

``` r
# Perform the equivalence test using an equivalence threshold of 1 with periods 
# 1-4 as pre-treatment periods based on the RMS testing procedure:
#  - option 1: using column names in the panel
# One can use the names of the columns in the panel to specify the variables:
rmsEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", X = c("X_1", "X_2"),
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4)
#> 
#>                ==================================================
#>                Equivalence Tests for Pre-trends in DiD Estimation
#>                ==================================================
#> Type: Root Mean Squared Placebo Effect 
#> Significance level: 0.05 
#> Alternative hypothesis: the root mean squared placebo effect does not exceed the equivalence threshold of 1 .
#> ---
#> RMS Placebo Effect   Simulated Crit. Val.    Reject H0 
#> 0.1281               0.957                   TRUE      
#> ---
#> No. placebo coefficients estimated: 3

#>  
#> Balanced Panel: 
#>  + No. pre-treatment periods: 4 
#>  + No. individuals: 500 
#>  + Total no. observations: 2000
```

``` r
#  - option 2: using column numbers in the panel 
# Alternatively, one can use the column numbers in the panel to specify the variables:
rmsEquivTest(Y = 3, ID = 1, G = 4, period = 2, X = c(5, 6),
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4)
             
#  - option 3: using separate variables 
# One can also use the variables directly without specifying the data variable:
data_Y <- sim_data$Y
data_ID <- sim_data$ID
data_G <- sim_data$G
data_period <- sim_data$period
data_X <- cbind(sim_data$X_1, sim_data$X_2)

rmsEquivTest(Y = data_Y, ID = data_ID, G = data_G, period = data_period, X = data_X,
             equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4)
```

The testing procedures can also be performed without specifying the
equivalence threshold. Then, the minimum equivalence threshold is
returned for which the null hypothesis of non-negligible
trend-differences can be rejected. Again, the three possible ways of
entering the data as above can be used.

``` r
rmsEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", X = c("X_1", "X_2"),
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = NULL, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4)
#> 
#>                ==================================================
#>                Equivalence Tests for Pre-trends in DiD Estimation
#>                ==================================================
#> Type: Root Mean Squared Placebo Effect 
#> Significance level: 0.05 
#> Alternative hypothesis: the root mean squared placebo effect does not exceed the equivalence threshold.
#> ---
#> RMS Placebo Effect   Min. Equiv. Threshold 
#> 0.1281               0.2436                
#> ---
#> No. placebo coefficients estimated: 3 
#> Base period: 4 
#>  
#> Balanced Panel: 
#>  + No. pre-treatment periods: 4 
#>  + No. individuals: 500 
#>  + Total no. observations: 2000
```

Finally, one should note that the test procedure also works for
unbalanced panels.

``` r
# To illustrate this, we generate an unbalanced panel dataset by randomly selecting
# 70% of the observations from the balanced panel dataset:

random_indeces <- sample(nrow(sim_data), 0.7*nrow(sim_data))
unbalanced_sim_data <- sim_data[random_indeces, ]
#  With Equivalence Threshold:
rmsEquivTest(Y = 3, ID = 1, G = 4, period = 2, X = c(5, 6),
             data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, 
             pretreatment_period = 1:4, base_period = 4)

#  Without Equivalence Threshold:
rmsEquivTest(Y = 3, ID = 1, G = 4, period = 2, X = c(5, 6),
             data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = NULL, 
             pretreatment_period = 1:4, base_period = 4)
```

### The `maxEquivTest` function

`maxEquivTest` implements the equivalence testing procedure surrounding
the maximum absolute placebo coefficient. The function tests the null
hypothesis that the maximum absolute placebo coefficient is larger than
or equal to a user-specified equivalence threshold, $\delta$, indicating
what negligible is to the user. That is, if

$$\lVert\beta\rVert_\infty = \max_{l=1,...T} |\beta_l|,$$

the tested hypotheses can be represented as

$$H_0: \lVert\beta\rVert_\infty \geq \delta \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \lVert\beta\rVert_\infty < \delta.$$

The null and alternative hypothesis can therefore be seen as
non-negligible and negligible differences in pre-trends, respectively.

The function `maxEquivTest` contains three testing procedures for this
test, as described in Section 4.2.1. of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121)). The function
allows for the testing of the equivalence of pre-trends using a
bootstrap for spherical errors (`type = "Boot"`), a wild bootstrap for
clustered standard errors (`type = "Wild"`), and an Intersection Union
approach (`type = "IU"`) that rejects the null if all
$\hat{\beta}_1,...,\hat{\beta}_{T}$ are significantly smaller than their
individual critical values. The function returns an object of class
`maxEquivTestBoot` if `type = "Boot"` or `type = "Wild"` or
`maxEquivTestIU` if `type = "IU"`. If no type is specified,
`maxEquivTest` applies the Intersection Union procedure for efficiency
reasons.

#### Implemention of the `maxEquivTest` function with `type = "IU"`

Examples of implementing the Intersection unit test with different
possible variance-covariance matrices (required to perform the test) are
provided below (for more information on the possible variance-covariance
matrices, see the documentation of the `maxEquivTest` function). If an
equivalence threshold is supplied, the function will test the previous
hypothesis. If no equivalence threshold is supplied, the function finds
the minimum equivalence threshold for which the null of non-negligible
trend-differences can be reject using the Intersection Union test. The
function returns an object of class `maxEquivTestIU` containing the
following information:

- `placebo_coefficients`: A numeric vector of the estimated placebo
  coefficients,
- `abs_placebo_coefficients`: A numeric vector with the absolute values
  of estimated placebo coefficients,
- `placebo_coefficients_se`: A numeric vector with the standard errors
  of the placebo coefficients,
- `significance_level`: The chosen significance level of the test,
- `base_period`: The base period used in the testing procedure,
- `placebo_names`: The names corresponding to the placebo coefficients,
- `num_individuals`: The number of cross-sectional individuals in the
  panel used for testing,
- `num_periods`: The number of pre-treatment periods in the panel used
  for testing (if the panel is unbalanced, `num_periods` represents the
  range in the number of time periods covered by different individuals),
- `num_observations`: The number of observations in the panel used for
  testing,
- `is_panel_balanced`: A logical value indicating whether the panel data
  is balanced,
- `equiv_threshold_specified`: A logical value indicating whether an
  equivalence threshold was specified.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = TRUE`, then additionally:
  - `IU_critical_values`: A numeric vector with the individual critical
    values for each of the placebo coefficients,
  - `reject_null_hypothesis`: A logical value indicating whether the
    null hypothesis of negligible pre-trend differences can be rejected
    at the specified significance level,
  - `equiv_threshold`: The equivalence threshold employed.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = FALSE`, then additionally:
  - `minimum_equiv_thresholds`: A numeric vector including for each
    placebo coefficient the minimum equivalence threshold for which the
    null hypothesis of negligible pre-trend differences can be rejected
    for the corresponding placebo coefficient individually,
  - `minimum_equiv_threshold`: A numeric scalar minimum equivalence
    threshold for which the null hypothesis of negligible pre-trend
    differences can be rejected for all placebo coefficients.

One should note that rows containing `NA` values are removed from the
panel before the testing procedure is performed.

``` r
# Perform the test with equivalent threshold specified as 1 based on 
# pre-treatment periods 1-4 and homoscedastic error-terms:
  # To select variables, one can use the column names / numbers in the panel data
maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = 2, X= c(5,6),
              data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
              base_period = 4, type = "IU")

vcov_func <- function(x) {plm::vcovHC(x, method = "white1", type = "HC2")}
maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "IU", vcov = vcov_func)
 
# Perform the test using clustered standard errors based on a vector indicating 
# the cluster. For instance, two clusters with the following rule: all
# individuals with an ID below 250 are in the same cluster.
cluster_ind <- ifelse(sim_data$ID < 250, 1, 2)
maxEquivTest(Y = data_Y, ID = data_ID, G = data_G, period = data_period, X = data_X,
               equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
               base_period = 4, type = "IU", vcov = "CL", cluster = cluster_ind)
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'clubSandwich':
#>   method    from    
#>   bread.mlm sandwich
```

Note that the testing procedure can also handle unbalanced panels.

``` r
# To illustrate this, we generate an unbalanced panel dataset by randomly selecting
# 70% of the observations from the balanced panel dataset:
random_indeces <- sample(nrow(sim_data), 0.7*nrow(sim_data))
unbalanced_sim_data <- sim_data[random_indeces, ]
maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", X = c(5, 6),
              data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
              base_period = 4, type = "IU", vcov = "HAC")
```

##### Implementation of the bootstrap approaches

Examples of implementing the bootstrap based test are provided below.
For both `type = "Boot"` and `type = "Wild"`, an equivalence threshold
is required to perform the test. Furthermore, both testing procedures
return an object of class “maxEquivTestBoot” containing

- `placebo_coefficients`: A numeric vector of the estimated placebo
  coefficients,
- `abs_placebo_coefficients`: A numeric vector with the absolute values
  of estimated placebo coefficients,
- `max_abs_coefficient`: The maximum absolute estimated placebo
  coefficient,
- `B`: The number of bootstrap samples used to find the critical value,
- `significance_level`: The chosen significance level of the test
  `alpha`,
- `base_period`: The base period used in the testing procedure,
- `placebo_names`: The names corresponding to the placebo coefficients,
- `num_individuals`: The number of cross-sectional individuals in the
  panel used for testing,
- `num_periods`: The number of pre-treatment periods in the panel used
  for testing (if the panel is unbalanced, `num_periods` represents the
  range in the number of time periods covered by different individuals),
- `num_observations`: The total number of observations in the panel used
  for testing,
- `is_panel_balanced`: A logical value indicating whether the panel data
  is balanced,
- `equiv_threshold_specified`: A logical value indicating whether an
  equivalence threshold was specified.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = TRUE`, then additionally:
  - `bootstrap_critical_value`: The by bootstrap found critical value
    for the equivalence test based on the maximum absolute placebo
    coefficient,
  - `reject_null_hypothesis`: A logical value indicating whether the
    null hypothesis of negligible pre-trend differences can be rejected
    at the specified significance level `alpha`,
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = FALSE`, then additionally:
  - `minimum_equiv_threshold`: The minimum equivalence threshold for
    which the null hypothesis of negligible pre-trend differences can be
    rejected for the bootstrap procedure.

One should note that rows containing `NA` values are removed from the
panel before the testing procedure is performed.

The bootstrap for spherical errors with 1000 bootstrap iterations:

The Wild boostrap with 1000 bootstrap iterations:

maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period",

```

The bootstrap procedures can handle unspecified equivalence thresholds:

``` r
maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = NULL, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "Boot", B = 1000)
maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = NULL, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "Wild", B = 1000)
```

The bootstrap procedures can handle unbalanced panels:

``` r
 maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
             data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, 
             pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "Boot", B = 1000)
 maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
             data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, 
             pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "Wild", B = 1000) 
```

### The `meanEquivTest` function

The meanEquivTest implements the equivalence testing procedure
surrounding the mean placebo coefficient, as described in Section 4.2.2.
of Dette & Schumann
([2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2024.2308121)). The function
tests the null hypothesis that the absolute mean placebo coefficient is
larger than or equal to a user-specified equivalence threshold,
$\delta$, indicating what negligible is to the user. That is, if

$$\bar{\beta} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{l=1}^{T} \beta_l,$$

the tested hypotheses can be represented as

$$H_0: |\bar{\beta}| \geq \delta \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: |\bar{\beta}| < \delta.$$

The null and alternative hypothesis can therefore be seen as
non-negligible and negligible differences in pre-trends, respectively.
Implementation of the test is similar to the `maxEquivTest` function in
terms of the possible variance-covariance matrices (for more information
on the possible variance-covariance matrices, see the documentation of
the `meanEquivTest` function). The function returns an object of class
`meanEquivTest` containing

- `placebo_coefficients`: A numeric vector of the estimated placebo
  coefficients,
- `abs_mean_placebo_coefs`: The absolute value of the mean of the
  placebo coefficients,
- `var_mean_placebo_coef`: The estimated variance of the mean placebo
  coefficient,
- `significance_level`: The significance level of the test,
- `base_period`: The base period used in the testing procedure,
- `num_individuals`: The number of cross-sectional individuals in the
  panel used for testing,
- `num_periods`: The number of pre-treatment periods in the panel used
  for testing (if the panel is unbalanced, `num_periods` represents the
  range in the number of time periods covered by different individuals)
- `num_observations`: The total number of observations in the panel used
  for testing,
- `is_panel_balanced`: A logical value indicating whether the panel is
  balanced,
- `equiv_threshold_specified`: A logical value indicating whether an
  equivalence threshold was specified.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = TRUE`, then additionally:
  - `mean_critical_value`: The critical value at the alpha level,
  - `p_value`: The p-value of the test,
  - `reject_null_hypothesis`: A logical value indicating whether to
    reject the null hypothesis,
  - `equiv_threshold`: The equivalence threshold specified.
- If `equiv_threshold_specified = FALSE`, then additionally:
  - `minimum_equiv_threshold`: The minimum equivalence threshold for
    which the null hypothesis of non-negligible (based on the
    equivalence threshold) trend-differences can be rejected.

One should note that rows containing `NA` values are removed from the
panel before the testing procedure is performed.

``` r
# Perform the test with equivalent threshold specified as 1 based on 
# pre-treatment periods 1-4 and assuming homoscedastic error-terms:
  # To select variables, one can use the column names / column numbers in the panel data:
  meanEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = 2, X = c(5, 6),
                data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
                base_period = 4)

``` r
  # Alternatively, one can use separate variables:
  data_Y <- sim_data$Y
  data_ID <- sim_data$ID
  data_G <- sim_data$G
  data_period <- sim_data$period
  data_X <- sim_data[, c(5, 6)]
  meanEquivTest(Y = data_Y, ID = data_ID, G = data_G, period = data_period, X = data_X,
                equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,

meanEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", X = c(5, 6),
              data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = NULL, pretreatment_period = 1:4,

# Perform the test with an equivalence threshold of 1 and a custom
# variance-covariance matrix estimator:
vcov_func <- function(x) {plm::vcovHC(x, method = "white1", type = "HC2")}
meanEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
              data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
              base_period = 4, vcov = vcov_func)
               
# Perform the test using clustered standard errors based on a vector indicating 
# the cluster. For instance, two clusters with the following rule: all
# individuals with an ID below 250 are in the same cluster:
cluster_ind <- ifelse(sim_data$ID < 250, 1, 2)
meanEquivTest(Y = data_Y, ID = data_ID, G = data_G, period = data_period, X = data_X,
               equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
               base_period = 4, vcov = "CL", cluster = cluster_ind)
```

Note that the testing procedure can also handle unbalanced panels:

``` r
# Finally, one should note that the test procedure also works for unbalanced panels.
# To illustrate this, we generate an unbalanced panel dataset by randomly selecting
# 70% of the observations from the balanced panel dataset:
random_indeces <- sample(nrow(sim_data), 0.7*nrow(sim_data))
unbalanced_sim_data <- sim_data[random_indeces, ]
meanEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", X = c(5, 6),
              data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
              base_period = 4, vcov = "HAC")
```
