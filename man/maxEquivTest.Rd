\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric vector with the variable of interest. If \code{data} is supplied, \code{Y} should be a scalar indicating the column number or column-name character string that corresponds to the numeric dependent (outcome) variable in ’data’.}

\item{ID}{A numeric vector identifying the different cross-sectional units in the dataset. If \code{data} is supplied, \code{ID} should be a scalar indicating the column number or column-name character string that corresponds to the cross-sectional units identifier in \code{data}.}

\item{G}{A binary or logic vector (of the same dimension as \code{Y} and \code{ID}) indicating if the individual (e.g. as indicated by \code{ID}) receives treatment (e.g. 1 or TRUE) or not (0 or FALSE). If 'data' is supplied, \code{G} should be a scalar identifying the column number or column-name character string associated to \code{G} in \code{data}.}

\item{period}{A numeric vector (of the same dimension as Y) indicating time. If \code{data} is supplied, \code{period} should be a scalar indicating the column number or column-name character string that corresponds to the time identifier in \code{data}.}

\item{X}{A vector, matrix, or data.frame containing the control variables. If \code{data} is supplied, \code{X} must be a vector of column numbers or column-name character strings that identifies the control variables’ columns.}

\item{data}{An optional \code{data.frame} object containing the variables in Y, ID, G, T and, if supplied, X and cluster as its columns.}

\item{equiv_threshold}{The scalar equivalence threshold (must be positive). The default is NULL, implying that the function must look for the minimum value for which the null hypothesis of ”non-negligible differences” can still be rejected.}

\item{pretreatment_period}{A numeric vector identifying the pre-treatment periods that should be used for testing. \code{pretreatment_period} must be a subset of the periods included through \code{period}. The default is to use all periods that are included in \code{period}.}

\item{base_period}{The pre-treatment period to compare the post-treatment observation to. The default is to take the last period of the pre-treatment period.}

\item{type}{The type of maximum test that should be performed. "IU" for the intersection-union test, "Boot" for the regular bootstrap procedure from Dette & Schumann (2024) and "Wild" for the Wild bootstrap procedure.}

\item{vcov}{If \code{type = "IU"}, the variance-covariance matrix that needs to be used. See \emph{Details} for more details.}

\item{cluster}{If \code{vcov = "CL"}, a vector indicating which observations belong to the same cluster. \code{cluster} must be of the same length as the panel. If \code{data} is supplied, \code{cluster} must be either the column index or column name of this vector in the data.frame/matrix. The default (\code{cluster=NULL}) assumes every unit in ID is its own cluster. Only required if \code{vcov = "CL"} and \code{type = "IU"}.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level of the test. The default is 0.05. Only required if \code{equiv_threshold} is not specified.}

\item{B}{If type = Boot or type = Wild, the number of bootstrap samples used. The default is 1000.}

\description{
This function performs an equivalence test for pre-trends based on the maximum absolute placebo coefficient from Dette & Schumann (2024). The test can be performed using the intersection-union approach (IU), a bootstrap procedure for spherical errors (Boot) and a wild bootstrap procedure (Wild).
}
\details{
The \code{vcov} parameter specifies the variance-covariance matrix to be used in the function for \code{type = "IU"}. 
This parameter can take two types of inputs:
\enumerate{
\item A character string specifying the type of variance-covariance matrix estimation. The options are:\itemize{
   \item \code{NULL}: The default variance-covariance matrix estimated by the \link[plm]{plm} function is used.
   \item \code{"HC"}: A heteroscedasticity-robust (HC) covariance matrix is estimated using the \code{vcovHC} function from the \code{plm} package, \link[plm]{vcovHC}, with type \code{"HC1"} and method \code{"white1"} (see White, 1980).
   \item \code{"HAC"}: A heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAC) covariance matrix is estimated using the \code{vcovHC} function from the \code{plm} package, \link[plm]{vcovHC}, with type \code{"HC3"} and method \code{"arellano"} (see Arellano, 1987).
   \item \code{"CL"}: A cluster-robust covariance matrix is estimated using the \code{vcovCR} function from the \code{clubSandwich} package with type \code{"CR0"} (see Lian & Zegers (1986)). The cluster variable is either \code{"ID"} or a custom cluster variable provided in the \code{data} dataframe.
}
\item A function that takes an \link[plm]{plm} object as input and returns a variance-covariance matrix. 
   This allows for custom variance-covariance matrix estimation methods. For example, you could 
   use the \code{vcovHC} function from the \code{sandwich} package with a specific method and type:
   \preformatted{function(x) {vcovHC(x, method = "white1", type = "HC2")}}
}
If no \code{vcov} parameter is provided, the function defaults to using the variance-covariance matrix 
estimated by the \link[plm:plm]{plm::plm()} function.

One should note that rows containing \code{NA} values are removed from the panel before the testing procedure is performed.

NOTE: Please be aware that including control variables (X) might lead to higher computation times for type = "Boot" and type = "Wild", due to unconstrained parameters in the optimization problem that estimates the constrained placebo coefficients.

On top of that, please be aware that the bootstrap procedures for the equivalence test based on the maximum absolute placebo coefficient apply a bootstrap procedure (as described by Dette & Schumann (2024)), leading to a stochastic critical value and minimum equivalence threshold. Therefore, the results may vary slightly between different runs of the function.

# Generate a balanced panel dataset with 500 cross-sectional units (individuals), 
# 5 time periods (labeled 1-5), a binary variable indicating which individual 
# receives treatment and 2 control variables ("X_1" and "X_2") The error-terms are generated without 
# heteroscedasticity,  autocorrelation, or any significant clusters. 
# Furthermore, there are no fixed effects (lambda and eta are both vectors 
# containing only 0) and no pre-trends present in the data (all values in 
# beta are 0). See sim_paneldata() for more details.

sim_data <- sim_paneldata(N = 500, tt = 5, p = 2, beta = rep(0, 5), 
                          gamma = rep(1, 2), het = 0, phi = 0, sd = 1,

# -----------------  IU Approach -----------------

              base_period = 4, type = "IU")
  # Alternatively, one can enter the variables separately:
data_Y <- sim_data$Y
data_ID <- sim_data$ID
data_G <- sim_data$G
data_period <- sim_data$period
data_X <- sim_data[, c(5, 6)]

# and autocorrelation robust variance-covariance matrix estimator:
maxEquivTest(Y = 3, ID = 1, G = 4, period = 2, 
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = NULL, pretreatment_period = 1:4,

# Perform the test using clustered standard errors based on a vector indicating 
# the cluster. For instance, two clusters with the following rule: all
# individuals with an ID below 250 are in the same cluster.

# Note that the testing procedure can also handle unbalanced panels. 
# Finally, one should note that the test procedure also works for unbalanced panels.
# To illustrate this, we generate an unbalanced panel dataset by randomly selecting
# 70\% of the observations from the balanced panel dataset:
random_indeces <- sample(nrow(sim_data), 0.7*nrow(sim_data))

#-----------------  Bootstrap Approach -----------------

             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "Boot")

 # Perform the test with the equivalence threshold specified as 1 based on 
 # pre-treatment periods 1:4 (with base period 4) with the wild bootstrap procedure:
 maxEquivTest(Y = "Y", ID = "ID", G = "G", period = "period", 
             data = sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, pretreatment_period = 1:4,
             base_period = 4, type = "Wild")
 
 # The bootstrap procedures can handle unbalanced panels:

             data = unbalanced_sim_data, equiv_threshold = 1, 
             pretreatment_period = 1:4,
